# cJSON language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting of cJSON files in Atom.

This language pack is based on the [JSON language pack](http://github.com/atom/language-json.git).

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [JSON TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/json.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
